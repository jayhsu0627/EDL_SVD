Built-in cabinets and a lone barstool. A rustic wooden table, metal stools, and a bicycle frame; a plant, flowers, and prints.",
    "Subdued industrial bathroom: terrazzo walls and exposed wood beams above hardwood floors. A long dark-stone vanity holds twin sinks beneath unlit mirrors, with a succulent and toiletry bottles between. To the right, a freestanding tub under a shuttered window and a potted plant. A deep-blue wave-pattern rug lies underfoot, faucets and countertop.",
    "Softly lit patient room with two white beds featuring orange rails under half-drawn blinds. A wooden nightstand holds a small lamp beside an IV pole and tray. Opposite, wood-paneled cabinets flank a recessed sink. A metal chair and sofa bench display plush toys."]
